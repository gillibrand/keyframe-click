## About Keyframe Click

Keyframe Click is a way to visually create CSS property animations by placing BÃ©zier curves on a
timeline.

### Getting started

1. Add a CSS property above the timeline, or change the current one in the sidebar.
2. Add and drag points to create a curve that changes the property's value over time.
3. Change a selected point's style to `Round` for smooth curves.
4. Copy the animation as a CSS `@keyframes` statement to use in your own projects.

### Tips ðŸ”¥

- Use the `More keyframes` slider to add additional keyframes to rounded curves for smoother
  animations.
- Check `Flip values` when working with `Translate Y` so that "up" in your timeline is "up" in your
  animation.
- Type <kbd>?</kbd> to learn keyboard shortcuts.
